These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for m_o:
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)



### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development

    $ cargo build --release
    $ cd target/release

    # Then move it somewhere in your $PATH. Here is an example:
    $ mv m_o ~/bin
